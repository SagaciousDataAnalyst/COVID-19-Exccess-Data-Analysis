# COVID-19-Exccess-deaths-Data-Analysis
Description and Role: As COVID-19 has spread around the world, people have become seriously familiar with the death tolls that their governments publish each day. Unfortunately, these tend to undercount the true number of fatalities that the disease has already caused. In many places, official daily figures exclude anybody who did not die in hospital or who did not test positive. Often the cause of death takes several days to establish and report, which creates a lag in the data. And even the most complete covid-19 records will not count people who were killed by conditions that might normally have been treated, had hospitals not been overwhelmed by a surge of patients needingintensive care.
A better way to measure the damage caused by such a medical crisis is to look at “excess mortality”: the gap between the total number of people who died from any cause, and the historical average for the same place andtime of year.

# Project  Responsibilities:
 1. Communicated and coordinated with other enthusiasts to gather effective data for problem statement.
2.  Data preprocessing which includes checking missing values, unnecessary columns and melting data was carried out using NumPy and Pandas libraries.
3.  Participated in live cases track such as performing post and pre-covid data gathering and understand the scenarios for normalization and label encoding with Scikit-learn preprocessing.
4.  EDA Explored on different dataset using Matplotlib and Seaborn and analyzed whether death cases have trending or seasonality pattern.
5.  Experimented and built predictive models such as Linear Regression using Scikit-learn and Stats-model library. help of graphs using Tableau, Matplotlib and Seaborn library.
